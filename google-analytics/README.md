## Google Analytics Connectors

Here you can find several connectors / scripts that authenticate to the Google Analytics API v4 using JWT (Json Web Tokens) and retrieve several metrics and dimensions.

All connectors are based on the **User Explorer** report from the Google Analytics console. Several steps are required for setting up custom clients ids in order to retrieve user explorer data from the API, you can find a complete description [here](https://github.com/Morphl-Project/MorphL-Tracking-Settings).

- See [R](https://github.com/Morphl-Project/MorphL-Connectors/tree/master/google-analytics/R) folder for the R connector.
- See [node](https://github.com/Morphl-Project/MorphL-Connectors/tree/master/google-analytics/node) folder for the NodeJS / JavaScript connector (proof of concept / experimental).
- Python connector is soon to come.
